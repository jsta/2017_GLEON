The Effect of Lake Connectivity on Phosphorus Retention in Lakes

Background/Questions/Methods

A comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between lake characteristics and related biogeochemical cycles is essential for predicting lake nutrient retention and eutrophication risk. Although both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus loading contribute to eutrophication risk, studies on lake nutrient retention commonly focus solely on phosphorus (P) because of strong evidence that P rather than N is the primary limiting nutrient in lakes. Previous studies have demonstrated that P retention is strongly controlled by water residence time at very high and very low rates of hydrologic flushing. However, the factors that control P retention at intermediate flushing rates are less well-resolved. One potential explanatory factor for P retention differences in lakes with intermediate flushing is that they differ with respect to lake connectivity. To address this knowledge gap, I used an empirical mass-balance approach to model P retention in dozens of lakes as a function of lake connectivity, hydrologic flushing, climate, and land-use cover.

Results/Conclusions

I tested three model formulations including one that estimated a global first-order removal rate constant (k), one that estimated a separate k for each connectivity class, and one that estimated a separate k for each connectivity class, land-use cover class, and climate region. Of these three model formulations, separate estimation of k for each connectivity class led to the largest decrease in prediction error. While I this suggests that lake connectivity is a useful factor to include in P retention models, it is likely that connectivity per se does not control P retention. Rather, it serves as a proxy for unmeasured factors such as organic matter quality and lability.
